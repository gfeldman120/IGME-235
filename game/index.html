        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><i>Dig Dug</i> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth.
            <br>Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <b>Pooka</b> and <b>Fygar</b>, who will continually chase you around.
            <br>The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode.</p>
