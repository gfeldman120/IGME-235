        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>I'm Gavin Feldman, someone who loves virtual reality and games! My current goal is to keep my GPA where it is while making steady progress on my own personal project.
            <br>I'm taking this class (web tech) because I need to learn how to make a portfolio website. This aligns with my major, Game Design & Development, because a project is no good
            <br>to employers if I have nowhere to display it. I also think that doing this manually, using HTML, CSS and Javascript, shows my dedication. I want to continue to make friends
            <br>with aligning interests at RIT and, when I graduatue, leave with a job in programming.
        </p>
