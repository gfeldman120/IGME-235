                    </div>
                    <p>V-Armed is a first person shooter that I made for Virtual Reality (referred to as VR). It runs off of the Unity game engine and was in development from September 2023 to May 2024. The player selects a level (though, being a prototype, only 1 exists) and must defeat all of the enemies contained within. The player uses arms and shoulder blades, the main mechanics of the game, to defeat these enemies. Depending on how quick and efficient the player is, they’ll receive a score at the end of the level.
                    <br><br>Most VR games are slower to account for the medium: Not V-Armed! Perhaps it’s just bad design but I wanted to create a VR game that could match the adrenaline rush that fast flatscreen games provide. Motion sickness is a very real problem with VR and most VR games cater to it through their core designs. Although I still included a vignette feature, I wanted to disregard motion sickness for the sake of experimentation. This game wasn’t being properly published so I didn’t need to worry about retaining users - only trying out stuff to see what worked and what didn’t.
                    <br><br>Most of the fun of V-Armed comes from the randomness of the arms and both how quickly and efficiently the player can make use of what they have. If a player has no arms, they need to think quickly and make use of their shoulder blade. If a player has an arm equipped on one side and is holding another arm on the opposite side, do they throw it at an enemy? Or do they throw it in the air and shoot it to strengthen their equipped arm? Choices like these lead to interesting gameplay and make the player feel awesome.

                <h2>Developing a VR game in Unity without prior experience</h2>
                <div class="mainText">
                    <h3>Documentation with a surplus of free time</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p><b>Development time</b> - 9 months</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Before making V-Armed, I had quite literally never touched Unity or C#! The 1st month of my senior year of high school was spent planning out how I’d go about learning the tools I needed. By far the most helpful resource was documentation! More often than not, I ran into situations where I knew what I wanted to do but didn’t know how to go about it. A quick search through the documentation would usually yield me the components or classes I needed.
                    <br><br>One hurdle that I got over ahead of time was how to develop for VR. While I hadn’t touched Unity before, I was an avid VR enthusiast and played many VR games. As a player, I generally knew what felt good and what didn’t. I also knew of the most common complaints that players have about other people’s games. For example, many VR games use the thumbstick on your controllers as buttons. For the most popular VR systems in use at the time of development, clicking the thumbsticks like buttons was a quick way to deteriorate them. For this reason, I purposely avoided using those inputs. I also made a haptic slider because some hardware struggles to track correctly when the haptics are too strong (it’s unfair to assume that every player is playing on Steam, giving access to custom mappings and controller settings).
                    <br><br>While I hadn’t touched C# before making V-Armed, I wasn’t a stranger to programming. Through my classes in the CSAEA (Computer Science and Applied Engineering Academy), I got to play around with Javascript and Java. While studying these languages is one thing, applying them is another story. Thankfully, I had been reinforcing their concepts through making small projects in a VR game called Rec Room. The game’s visual scripting system (called “Circuits”) worked off of the same data types and functions that most common programming languages use. Being built off of Unity, most game specific functions were also nearly one-to-one copies of their Unity counterparts. The last real challenge of learning C# was syntax. Because its syntax is fairly consistent, it didn’t take long for me to grow accustomed to it.

                <h3 class="textTitle">Misc.</h3>
                <p>The game features a difficulty slider: This changes the player’s maximum health, enemy’s projectile speeds and enemy’s reaction times. At the hardest of difficulties, the player must be quick on their feet and use every tool available to them. One of these tools is the player’s ability to parry! By pressing their B/Y button while swinging their arm, projectiles near the player’s swinging hand will be deflected back at the nearest enemy with more strength and explosive capacity. You can also parry your own projectiles shortly after firing! This removes their homing abilities but makes them more explosive.

                <h3 class="smallTextTitle">These are the backbone of the game</h3>
                <p>V-Armed wouldn’t be a shooter without the player’s tools: Arms! When an arm is equipped, the player can shoot projectiles from their arms. The properties of the projectiles are determined randomly per arm. Enemies have their own arms and use them against the player. When defeated, enemies drop their arms for use by the player. Arms that the player uses have limited ammo so the player must keep defeating enemies to play effectively.

            <span class="line"></span>
            <div>
                <h3 class="textTitle">Arms</h3>
                <p>To equip an arm, all the player must do is grab one from the battlefield and drop it over their real arm. To unequip an arm, the player simply grabs their arm with their opposite hand. When unequipped and thrown, arms explode on impact like grenades! The radius, physics strength and damage of the explosion are determined by how much energy/ammo it had before removal. This creates an interesting choice: Use an arm normally or throw it for a big burst of damage! An arm will heal the player if it defeats an enemy while having a “healing charge” (a resource displayed on the HUD) while the player isn’t at maximum health.

                <h3 class="textTitle">Projectile Properties</h3>
                <p>Projectiles can have a multitude of properties. These include whether or not the projectile can lock onto enemies, pierce through multiple enemies or explode on impact. They can have gravity, bounces, be fired in bursts and have multiple be shot off at once. Projectiles can also interact with thrown arms: If an arm is shot mid-air, the arm will explode as if it was thrown and the projectiles that hit it redirect themselves at the nearest enemy or moving arm. This can be chained, exponentially increasing the strength (and explosive capacity) of the projectiles!

                <h2 class="bigTextTitle">HUD</h2>
                <h3 class="smallTextTitle">A tried and true way of providing information</h3>
                <p>The way a game displays information to players is extremely important. Many VR games display information out of the player’s forward view (typically on the player’s hands) because it allows the player to see as much of the world as possible. This works because VR games have a slower pace than their flatscreen counterparts. V-Armed is not a slow paced game! Players are constantly moving their bodies, making the HUD nearly impossible to read. For this reason, the HUD is attached to the player’s view, making it readable at a moment’s notice.

            <div>
                <h3 class="textTitle">Shoulder Blades</h3>
                <p>In V-Armed, the player’s main offensive tools are their collection of arms. If the player has none, they rely on their shoulder blades! To enable these, all the player must do is reach for their shoulder and press the trigger. These blades can be used to physically hit enemies. When the player does this, the enemy gets launched in the direction of the hit. The player can then jump in the direction of the enemy and chain hits. When the player is done with a given shoulder blade, they can either reach for their shoulder and press the trigger again or they can equip an arm over the blade.

            <div>
                <h3 class="textTitle">Grappling Hooks</h3>
                <p>Another function of the shoulder blade is the grappling hook! While the blade is equipped, a faint grey line points out from the end of the blade to wherever the player is pointing with their hand. If the trigger is pressed and held, a black line is shot out and attaches to what it hits. While the grappling hook is attached to a target, the player moves toward the target. The player can also adjust their trajectory by moving the arm that is using the grappling hook. Releasing the trigger disengages the grappling hook. Doing this while hooked to a target gives a burst of speed in the opposite direction of their hand’s movement!
