        <h2>Process/Meeting Requirements</h2>
        <p>After ensuring that my design met requirements, through checking my proposal with the professor, I did my best to build it 1 to 1 according to my sketch. This ensured that I had all of the controls I needed (checkboxes, quantity field, selection buttons).
        <br>While the HTML and CSS proved to be relatively straight forward, I had to do a lot of research on Javascript. The documentation is very in-depth so I was able to figure out how to use the input controls fairly quickly (alongside some trial and error).
        <br>The image saved in localStorage is loaded in the top left corner when the page is loaded. This image is a random dog if you've never searched before, or a dog from your previous search if you have.

        <h2>Other Notes</h2>
        <p>I had to figure out how to make the page auto scroll to the content area AFTER loading images and I had no idea how. Thankfully, a quick search taught me that we can move the window through Javascript!
        <br>If you look between the design picture and the website, you'll notice that sub breeds aren't drop downs: I thought it unnecessary because the breeds scrollbar is present.
