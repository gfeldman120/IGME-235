    <h1>Proposal</h1>
    <p>Due to the limited time frame for this project, I'm keeping my game simple. The player will be represented by a green cube. Their objective is to reach a blue cube within the given time frame. Randomly placed red cubes will block the player's path.
    <br>There is also a timer outside of the game view. If the timer runs out, the player must restart. The timer is extended by hitting the blue cube. When the blue cube is hit, it will move to a new location.
    <br>The red cubes will also swap places when the blue cube is hit or when the game starts. The player can wrap around the screen if need be.
    </p>

    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>If the game needs proper visuals, I can make the cubes into different images (ie, a mouse, cheese and bricks)</li>
        <li>Sound effects will play when the game starts, if the player tries to walk into an obstacle, if the player walks into the objective and when the game ends</li>
    </ul>
